        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have a pretty big family and I am never bored because of it. My family consists of three brothers and two beautiful dogs. I have one chocolate labrador for my first dog and I have a golden dudley labrador for my second dog that I got last christmas. I have the oldest brother at the age of 22 and he graduated college and his name is Zack. My other brother just went into college and he is Chris. My favorite Major League Baseball team is the dodgers and my favorite pitcher on their team is Clayton Kershaw.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p> What I like to do for my hobbies when I am bored are fishing, playing baseball, playing any other sport cause they are all fun, and I also like to hangout with my friends or go somewhere with them. I will play any sport because I think that they are all fun when you are playing with your friends. Especially tackle football because then you get to tackle your friends and its fun. I enjoy any of those hobbies.</p>
