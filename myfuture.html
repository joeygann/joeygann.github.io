            <h2>College</h2>
            <p> I want to go to UCLA for college if I can get good grades because UCLA is a very good school and has a lot of activities to do and it is a very good academic school.</p>

            <h2>Career Interests</h2>
            <p> When I get older I want to play in the MLB but if I don't make it to the MLB then I will most likely be trying to become a firefighter because I want to save peoples lives from fire and it would be a cool experience.</p>
