        <h2>ATM</h2>
        <p> Atm is very creative and challenging at times but Ms. Milton makes it easier when she explains and shows how to do it. All of the websites that she has shown us helped a lot too.</p>

            <h2>College</h2>
            <p> I want to go to UCLA for college if I can get good grades because UCLA is a very good school and has a lot of activities to do and it is a very good academic school.</p>

        <h2>Career Interests</h2>
            <p> When I get older I want to play in the MLB but if I don't make it to the MLB then I will most likely be trying to become a firefighter because I want to save peoples lives from fire and it would be a cool experience.</p>
